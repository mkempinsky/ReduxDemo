- The entire state of our application lives inside an object called the store
- In order to update the state, we need to dispatch an action.
- Actions are nothing but Javascript objects with a type property which describes the event taking place.
- Once the action has been dispatched, it is recieved by the reducer.
- The reducer takes in the current state of the application and the dispatched action, 
  and then produces the next state of the application based on the action.type

- For our React application to use the Redux store, we use the Provider component,
  which is provided by the react-redux library. The Provider component is put at the root of 
  all the components.
- In order to acces our Redux store within our React components, we use the special connect() function. 
  This function gives us access to dispatch and when we pass in mapStateProps, it gives us access to the state.
- mapStateProps is a function that takes in the state of our application as a parameter and returns an object
  with keys of that object becoming the props of the component. So whenever we use this.props.key_name we get
  back the state we need.
